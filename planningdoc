#the average delay time for flights increase leading up to christmas.
-set an x axis which is days leading up to christmas
-for each x the y is going to be a mean leading up to that day 
-if time delay is 20 minutes or later add that to the mean
-dont includes data points that are on time or are less than scheduled departure times
#average actual departure times are at a later time than the scheduled time for all flgihts.
-find the mean and compare them 
#the average delay time has no correlation to the time of day in units of hours on the x axis
-wanna create a line graph connecting the point but also have a the margin of error on the graph 
-need to review my stats note from high school
